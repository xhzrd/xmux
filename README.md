# xmux

**xmux** is a C++ project that lets you embed (almost) **any Windows GUI application** directly inside a terminal window, including Command Prompt, PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Alacritty, Gitbash, and more.  
Think of it as *window inception*, running graphical apps *inside* terminal windows, with proper event handling.

It's **not** MPV-exclusive, MPV was just a convenient test case for me. You can embed literally any HWND-based GUI app.

## Features

- Run (almost) **any Windows GUI app** inside a terminal window.
- Works in **Command Prompt**, **PowerShell**, **Gitbash**, **Alacritty** and **Windows Terminal**.
- Compatible with both **native Windows apps** and cross-platform ones (Must be compatiable to run in Windows).
- Minimal dependencies: just pure Win32 API and C++.
- Terminal and child window interaction with no drag/move glitches.

## Building

You'll need:

- **CMake** (with Ninja generator)
- **Clang** (recommended for building)
- **Windows 10+**
- A terminal that supports resizing & drawing (CMD/PowerShell works fine)

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/xhzrd/xmux.git
cd xmux

# 2. Create & go inside the build folder
mkdir build
cd build

# 3. Generate build files using Clang + Ninja
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ..
